Set customized instructions. Needs to be valid JSON code. 
Example:

"atom_colors" : [
    "H/1/1/#ff0000",
    "H/2/2/#00ff00",
    "H/3/3/#0000ff",
    "H/4/4/#ff00ff"
],
"atom_radii" : [
    "C/0/0/1.0",
    "H/0/0/0.5"
],

Note that only the validity of the JSON object is being tested.
Further evaluation of the JSON instructions are handled by the
Blender program and are not pre-evaluated.
